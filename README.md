## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a junior data engineer with a growing passion for building efficient, scalable data pipelines using modern tools and technologies. This space is where I share my learning journey, personal projects, and experiments as I continue to sharpen my skills in the world of data engineering.

My current focus is on developing and maintaining end-to-end ETL workflows using tools like Apache Airflow, writing performant SQL for data transformations, and working with cloud platforms to handle data at scale. I'm particularly interested in how data flows through systemsâ€”how itâ€™s collected, cleaned, transformed, and ultimately used to drive insights and decisions.

Most of the work here is hands-on practiceâ€”real-world inspired projects designed to simulate production environments. Whether itâ€™s orchestrating DAGs in Airflow, designing robust data models, or optimizing queries for large datasets, each project helps me explore new techniques and solidify best practices.

As someone early in the data engineering field, Iâ€™m focused not only on writing functional code, but also on building solutions that are reliable, maintainable, and well-documented. I believe clean architecture and good documentation are just as important as the code itself, especially when working in a collaborative environment.

This repository is both a portfolio and a playgroundâ€”a place to showcase what Iâ€™ve learned and connect with others in the community. I welcome feedback, suggestions, and collaboration from fellow data enthusiasts, engineers, and learners alike.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute. Every project here is a step toward becoming a stronger engineer and a better problem-solver.
